# ssmenv
This package allows you to load environment variables from SSM. Any environment variable whose value is set as `LOADFROMSSM:<ssm-parameter-name>` will be loaded with the correct value from SSM. To use it, import this package as `_ "github.com/corbaltcode/go-libraries/ssmenv"` wherever the environment variable is being used, and the `ssmenv` script with set the correct value. 

For example, if you have a SSM parameter named `example-ssm-parameter` whose value you'd like to set on an environment variable named `ENVIRONMENT_VAR`, you'd set this environment variable with the follwoing: `ENVIRONMENT_VAR=LOADFROMSSM:example-ssm-parameter`. In your Go code that uses `ENVIRONMENT_VAR`, you'd import this pacakge as explained above, and the correct value will be loaded from SSM for `ENVIRONMENT_VAR`
